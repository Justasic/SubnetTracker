{# The point of this document is to have all pages inherit from it. #}
{# This inheritance makes all pages equal in how their HTML is formatted. #}
{# there are basic 'head' and 'body' blocks for most of the content as well #}
{# as 'scripts' and 'title' blocks. #}
{# This file has been in every django project I ever worked on and it doesn't change much. #}
